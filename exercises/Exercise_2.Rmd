## How to run statistics
In the first exercise, we created a set of ERPs. Now we'll practice some ggplot2 skills using the dataframe we created.

Clear your workspace (press the broom icon in the upper right pane) and load the file you saved.

Remember, help for any command can be looked up using ?command in console, or searching for it in the help pane.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

load('../user_data/final_df.RData')
head(final_df)
```
