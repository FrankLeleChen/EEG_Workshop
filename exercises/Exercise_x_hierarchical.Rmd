Two different approaches to hierarchichal modelling.



Fit a GLM at the individual level

This is a first-level analysis



```{r run_lme}

```



Take the parameter estimates to the second-level



```{r}

```


## Linear mixed effect model

The above approach is sometimes called the summary statistic approach, and is an approximation.

You can also model both the subject and 


```{r}




```
